# CSharp_Learning
Collection of C# code written while learning the language
<p>
So I decided to pick up a new programming language to start coding in. So, this repository intends to serve as the online catalogue of
the codes that I have written whilst learning the language. I am using the <a href = "https://www.sololearn.com/play/CSharp/" target ="_blank">Sololearn website</a> while learning this language. This repos should finally look like a set of compressed files containing CSharp Codes which aren't really meant to serve any purpose except maybe help me if I ever needed a backup.
